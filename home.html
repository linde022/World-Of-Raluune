			<p>Centuries after the world's downfall, people rebuilt in the
				last remaining forest, giving way to the city of Neo Eclipse.
				At first, the city was peaceful and everyone worked together, 
				but as technology improved, so did the leaders' greed. Some people
				escaped before it was too late, taking refuge in the wasteland sands
				to the south. Others took what they had  and built their own cities
				around Neo Eclipse. These cities would take to war with Neo Eclipse.
				Unfortunately, these cities failed and the citizens assimilated back into
				Neo Eclipse.
			</p>
			<p>Amongst news of a supersoldier designed in the  war escaping
				Empyra's hold, talk of a revolution started. That very same
				supersoldier would later serve as the catalyst to spark the revolution.
			</p>
			<P>To the south, nothing much happened. Those living here banded
				together for safety from the beasts that now called this place
				home. Magic and spirituality took hold in this region, as the Drace,
				an endemic species of dragon, took to protect the people.
			</P>
			<p>In order to understand the full history of this world, one must
				know of it's places and their roles in the formation of the cultures
				and people.
