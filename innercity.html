			<p>The inner city is a place with riches and standing. Any individual here lightly
				has a powerful reputation and/or the money to buy their way out of anything.
			</p>
			<p>People here either don't care about the lower class, or aren't made aware of their situation.
				As such, not everyone here is cruel, the government just knows how to control the news and media.
