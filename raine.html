				<p>Raine was found not far outside of Fortitude, and quickly given care. Upon waking, she had amnesia about anything that had happened to her. It believed she was from Neo Eclipse, both due to her clothing as well
					as it just being common for newcomers to come from there.
				</p>

				<p>She's extremely soft spoken and shy, likely nervous and confused due to her amnesia.</p>
