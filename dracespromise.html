		<div class="culture-content">
			<p>At the fall of the old civilization, and the apparent distruction of the world, the Drace banded together and chose to sacrifice themselves to preserve what they could of the land.
				Only Wraith Island and the northern most point of Raluune remained forests. The rest stabilized into a sandy desert with scattered plant life.
			</p>
			<p>The prejudice humans have against Drace is likely due to their choice, as they blame the Drace, their gods, for abandoning them when things were at their worst. When the Drace instead
				did what they could to save the people.
			</p>
			<p>Drace have begun to reappear, as a Drace never truely dies. Instead they choose to be born as human to prevent another disaster like what happened. However, many Drace are remembering their past.
				Still, due to the prejudice, many Drace never leave their human forms.
