				<p>Helios is an individual of high interest in the city of Neo Eclipse. 
					As an escaped supersoldier, he is deemed a danger to the public and to government 
					assets. However, he's developed a rather loved reputation among the lower and 
					middle class population, being seen as the head of the revolution, though he 
					denies this whenever asked. After all, his motives aren't out of care for the 
					people, but rather revenge and his own selfish desires. He is well aware of this 
					and has tried voicing this numerous times, but eventually gave up on it when no one 
					would listen.</p>

				<p>Helios can come off as a very extroverted and happy personality, often cracking jokes 
					and starting up random conversations with anyone. However, this proves to be a mask 
					for who he really is. Due to his time with the government and in the Northern War, 
					he faced a lot of horrible events and people, and killed many himself. He carries 
					that with him. He chose to oppose Empyra out of revenge for what they did to him, and 
					he's devoted and motivated to a fault. He doesn't care about collatoral damage, to 
					people or property. Though, it should be said he's not reckless. An encounter with 
					another supersoldier taught him this lesson the hard way, costing him his right arm.</p>
