			<p>The government of Neo Elipse, otherwise known as Empyra, is the controlling
				force of this futuristic city. Originally meant as a way to keep peace, they
				led power go to their heads, and created divides between the rich and poor and
				massive restrictions based on what you can afford. 
			</p>
			<p>Empyra is also obssessed with progression through militrized means. This includes 
				both biological and mechanical experiments. They have created supersoldiers for
				the Northern War, as well as robots to act as law enforcement and guard animals.
				Some experiments are less humane, such as the abominations of combining parts,
				or forcing specialized abilities into people and creatures.
