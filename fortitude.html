				<p>Fortitude, the city in the center of Raluune. 
				A stronghold in the sands left by a previous era. People in the wasteland
				often struggle for survival with the lack of water and the monsters roaming
				above, on, and below the sands. However. Fortitude is a city built of stone 
				buildings and focused on sharing and trade and communication. People here 
				band together and form strong bonds. Even the Drace, a commonly neglected 
				race, find peace and happiness here.</p>
				<p>This city was formed by those who fled Neo Eclipse as soon as the corruption
					started and they took their chance with the unforgiving world beyond the 
					corporate walls. Among the more natural lifestyle of these people, magic
					has found some usage with the Drace teaching what they know.
