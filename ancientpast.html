		<div class="culture-content"><p>The civilization that came before the current one was modern and featured many earth-like amentities. However, the key difference was the Drace, a race of sentient
			creatures similar to dragons. This magical race was worshipped by humans, and were powerful voices of society.
			</p>
			<p>However, nothing lasts forever, as infighting broke out in the cities and countries of the old world over which Drace was the true god. This fighting inevitably led to ruin. Ruin that left the
				world in a dying state as plant life withered and died.
