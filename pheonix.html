				<p>A native of the Lesser Wastes, he knows the land well, and even walks alongside the creatures and monsters there. Despite being human, he is in no danger from even the Screaming Scorpions, who
					are known to greet the young man like a dog. No one knows why he is special, but it's useful to retrieve abandoned cargo or even to gather food.
				</p>

				<p>Pheonix doesn't really like people. He actually feels more at home with the monsters who've accepted him as one of them. However, he understands the struggles of his people and won't abandon them,
					even if he feels that's not his home.
