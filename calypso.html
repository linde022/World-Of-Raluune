				<p>Calypso is an ex-businessman from Neo Eclipse who went on a business trip to the 
					Greater Wastes, but was saved from the monsters by Xilanis, and led safely to where he
					remains today. She told him about how Drace used to be revered as gods, and he took that
					to heart and aims to reinstall Drace as humankind's leaders. Despite guidance from Drace
					insisting that his faith will only lead to ruin as it did before, he refuses to listen and
					is building a small cult-like following.
				</p>

				<p>Calypso is a very charismatic man, likely from his business days, and this has helped him gain 
					the following he has now. He was never religous until his experience with Xilanis, which she is 
					proud to have caused such an uproar. Now he works tirelessly to bring his faith to life. While
					extremely kind to everyone, people are wary of him as news has spread of what he's doing.
