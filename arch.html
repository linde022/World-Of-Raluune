				<p>Arch was one of the oldest Drace, and considered their leader in her past life. She
					was the one to iniate the sacrifice of the Drace race to save the world. As such,
					she has been viewed in high respect from other reborn Drace. However, in her current
					life, she has a calling to the past, but never understood why until she regained her 
					memories. Despite this, she still is working to recover the cracks in her memory and 
					find a way for Drace and humans to coexist peacefully and prevent another disaster.
				</p>

				<p>Arch as a Drace was noble and kind, and always looking out for others with no regard to
					herself. As such, she was viewed by both humans and other Drace as akin to a god. In her
					current life, even after remembering her past, she still retains a selfish streak, mostly 
					when it comes to her work and credits, but she is  rather selfless on all other accounts.
