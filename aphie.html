				<p>Aphie is the sister of Arch, and followed her footsteps and eventually joined her
					expedition to the Sandblown Ruins. Despite Arch being a Drace, Aphie was born as a
					human, but doesn't think of her sister any less. 
				</p>

				<p>Aphie is a tad on the tired side, always overworking herself and in turn, seeming
					cranky. She aims to reach the same level as Arch in her archeology and history skills.
					She comes off as rude and blunt due to her always being extremely tired.
